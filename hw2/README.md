# HW2 - Jython Implementation

To adapt the `ANN_*.py` files to your dataset:
- Change the `INPUT_LAYER` variable to reflect the number of features.
- Replace `bank_test.csv` and `bank_train.csv` in each file with your dataset.

Run with

```
jython ANN_back.py
```

- Add support for parameters if you got too much time
- Push helpful changes to this repo

Please add anything you find useful for coding up hw2 using scikit-learn or Python implementation thank you.
